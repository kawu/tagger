Morpho-syntactic tagger for Polish based on the Conditional Random Fields.


ABOUT

Written in Haskell morpho-syntactic tagger for Polish based on the Conditional Random Fields.
For now, it lacks morphological analysis phase and provides only disambiguation functionality.
It can be used together with Morfeusz SGJP morphological analyser, http://sgjp.pl/morfeusz/.
The tager has been developed with Morfeusz morphological tagset in mind, but it can be used
with other, similar tagsets or analysers.
